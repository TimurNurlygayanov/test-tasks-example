Introduction
------------

This repository contains many examples of QA Automation
tasks and code snippets. You can use it as a reference,
copy and paste the code and change as you wish.

I'm using these examples just to teach other QA engineers
to write good automated tests.

Best examples can be found in folder qa_python.
